                Plays and musicals illustrate many different lessons.

            <hr>
            <p>

                Theatre is the single most valuable place where kids can explore endless possibilities of their imaginations and what they can d

            <h3>Creativity</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Performing arts teach children how to think creatively through imagination.

                Through theatre, audiences are immersed in stories about characters from every background imaginable.

            <h3>Patience</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Children may not realise how different live theatre is from sitting in front of a TV or even a movie screen.
                They will learn how to sit quietly, respect others, and pay attention.
            </p>
